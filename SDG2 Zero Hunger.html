      </center>
      <h2>What is SDG 2?</h2>
      <p>SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. By 2030, the goal is to ensure that everyone has access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round.</p>
      <p>Hunger is a global crisis affecting millions of people, particularly in developing countries. It not only causes immense suffering but also hinders social and economic development.</p>
      <p>To achieve SDG 2, we must address key issues such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Food security and access to nutritious food</li>
        <li>Malnutrition, especially among children and vulnerable populations</li>
        <li>Sustainable agriculture and responsible food production</li>
        <li>Reducing food waste and promoting efficient supply chains</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By prioritizing sustainable and inclusive food systems, we can make significant progress towards ending hunger and ensuring a healthier and more prosperous future for all.</p>

      <h1>How India is implementing SDG 2</h1>
      <p>The National Food Security Act (NFSA): The NFSA guarantees food security to all citizens of India. The act provides subsidized food grains to eligible households through the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS).</p>
      <p>The Mid-Day Meal Scheme: The Mid-Day Meal Scheme provides free cooked meals to children in primary schools. The scheme aims to improve the nutritional status of children and reduce school dropout rates.</p>
      <p>The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY): The PMKSY is a major irrigation program that aims to provide water for irrigation to all farmers in India. The program is expected to improve agricultural productivity and reduce hunger.</p>
      <p>The National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA): The NMSA is a program that aims to promote sustainable agriculture in India. The program focuses on improving soil health, increasing crop diversification, and reducing the use of pesticides.</p>

      <h1 style="font-family:georgia,garamond">How can you help ??</h1>
      <p>One way that we can help to achieve this goal is by donating food or food items to those in need. There are many organizations that collect and distribute food to people who are struggling to put food on the table. By donating food, we can help to ensure that everyone has access to the food they need to live a healthy and productive life.</p>
      <i><p>However, we wanted to ask for your help in making a special donation this year to help us reach our goal of Zero Hunger.</p></i>
